# Emby.TV.SetupData
Home of TV Setup Data for Emby Server

## Pull Requests Welcome
Unlike other TV Applications, we're serious about keeping TV scan data up-to-date. Everybody is welcome to submit updates via Pull Requests.
After we have verified a contribution we will add the change to our database and the changes will immediately be available to all Emby Server installations, as the data gets updated automatically.

Thanks in advance to all contributors!
